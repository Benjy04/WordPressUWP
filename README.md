# Quickstart

## WordPress Plugins
Since WordPress 4.7 the REST API has been integrated into the core so there's no need for any plugins to get basic functionality. If you want to access protected endpoints, this library supports authentication through JSON Web Tokens (JWT) (plugin required).

* [WordPress 4.7 or newer](https://wordpress.org/)
* [JWT Authentication for WP REST API](https://wordpress.org/plugins/jwt-authentication-for-wp-rest-api/)

## Getting Started

Just clone or download the repo and open it in Visual Studio. Go to the `Config.cs` class inside the root folder and enter your site uri.

```c#
public static class Config
{
    public const string BaseUri = "http://yoursite.com/";
    public static string WordPressUri = $"{BaseUri}wp-json/";

    // Push Notification Settings
    public const string HubName = "NotificationHubName";
    public const string AccessSiganture = "Endpoint=";

    // Comments
    public static int CommentDepth = 3;
}

```
